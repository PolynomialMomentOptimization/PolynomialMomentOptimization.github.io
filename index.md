## What is Polynomial and Moment Optimization ?

Polynomial and Moment optimization is about finding global optima of optimization problems described by polynomial objective functions and polynomial constraints. 
These refer to primal programs directly expressed with polynomials and dual models on moments.

## What is presented here ?

- a [database](https://github.com/PolynomialMomentOptimization/data) of polynomial, moment and sdp problems.
- an overview of [software](software/index.html) for solving polynomial and moment optimization problems
