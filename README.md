# PolynomialMomentOptimization.github.io

Polynomial and Moment optimization is about finding global optima of optimization problems described by polynomial objective functions and polynomial constraints. 
These refer to primal programs directly expressed with polynomials and dual models on moments.

We present
- a database of polynomial, moment and sdp problems.
- an overview of software for solving polynomial and moment optimization problems
